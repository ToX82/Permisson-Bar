Permisson Bar
=============

Permission Bar is a free & simple solution to the EU cookie law.


## Why use Permission Bar?

There is a lot of mystery and fuss surrounding the new EU cookie legislation, but itâ€™s essentially really simple. Cookies are files used to track site activity and most websites use them. Site owners need to make the use of cookies very obvious to visitors.

Permission bar makes it simple and clear to visitors that cookies are in use and tells them how to adjust browser settings if they are concerned.


## Important Legal Reading

1. [Read the EU legislation on cookies](http://ec.europa.eu/ipg/basics/legal/cookies/index_en.htm)


## How it works?
 
Permisson Bar is pure vanilla javascript code, no jQuery or any other frameworks needed. If a website has a cookie or some localStorage data set then the bar is shown, otherwhise nothing happens.

Once user clicks 'Allow Cookies' Permission Bar will set a cookie for that domain with a name 'permissionbar' that will expire in 30 days. This means that the plugin will only show up once per domain (per month).

If a user decides to click "Disallow Cookies", Permissions Bar will simply remove all cookies and localStorage data.


## How to Install?

1. Grab the Github repo and place it on the server in its own directory. All the files, including images and stylesheets, need to maintain it's relative structure - that is be in the same directory - for the plugin to work correctly. 
2. Put the following code on all relevant pages of your website as the last thing before the &lt;/body&gt; tag.

Use this for the standard configuration

	<code>
	&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="PATH-TO/permissionbar-latest.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
	</code>

Or, if you need to configure it, you can do it like that:

	<code>
	&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="PATH-TO/permissionbar-latest.js?forceYes=1"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
	</code>

Here is a short list of parameters you can use:

    forceYes=1 <= hides deny consent button and text
    forceLang=XX <= force a specific language
